<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities</h1>
<p class="govuk-body-s"><strong>The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities</strong> was established in 2020 to review inequality in the UK, focusing on education, employment, health, and crime and policing.</p>

<p class="govuk-body-s">The Commission looked at outcomes for the whole population and published its 258-page report to the Prime Minister in March 2021. Led by evidence, the Commission put forward 24 recommendations to improve the lives and experiences of people and communities across the UK.</p>

<p class="govuk-body-s">The Commission report was a significant milestone in the UKâ€™s journey to equality of opportunity for all. The findings and evidence in the report presented a new and updated portrayal of race relations in the UK by delving beneath the surface of the various disparities that persist across our society and explaining how they have evolved over time.</p>

<p class="govuk-body-s">The Commission also provided the government with a coherent philosophy of approaching questions of racial equality in the UK given our rich and complex history and changes in ethnic diversity, society and technology that are reshaping our economy and our lives.</p>

<p class="govuk-body-s">The report delivered a compelling message to everyone: as a country we have made huge progress, but we can go further.</p>
