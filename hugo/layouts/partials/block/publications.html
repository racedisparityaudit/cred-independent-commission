                        <p class="govuk-body-s">The government's response to the Commission's findings, 'Inclusive Britain', sets out a groundbreaking action plan to tackle negative disparities, promote unity and build a fairer Britain for all.</p> 
                        <p class="govuk-body-s">It is guided by well established evidence, informed by the findings of the independent Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, and built on three overarching aims: Trust and fairness, opportunity and agency, and inclusion.</p> 
                        <p class="govuk-body-s">It sets out what the government intends to do to give everybody, from every community, in every corner of the UK, the opportunity to succeed.</p> 
                        <p class="govuk-body-s">The government is grateful to each of the Commissioners for their dedication and for giving up their time without remuneration to examine forensically an issue that matters deeply to people in the UK.</p>
